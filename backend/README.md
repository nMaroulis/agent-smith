# 🧠 AgentSmith

**AgentSmith** is a visual agent-building platform for LLM-based workflows. It lets you design complex AI agents using a drag-and-drop interface or natural language — then exports working Python code using LangChain and LangGraph.

### ✨ Features
- 🧩 Visual canvas for building tool-based agents
- 🗣️ Natural language to workflow/code generation
- ⚙️ Custom tool creation (describe → get Python function)
- 📄 Live editable code view (Monaco editor)
- 🧠 Supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, and local models (llama.cpp, Ollama)
- 🚀 Export to executable Python files or LangGraph chains

Whether you're building a chatbot, RAG system, or autonomous agent, **AgentSmith** helps you go from idea to runnable code in seconds.

> _“Your agent. Your logic. Your code.”_
